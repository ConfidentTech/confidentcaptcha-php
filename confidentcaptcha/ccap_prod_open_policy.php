/**
 * Confident CAPTCHA policy for production, server failures leave page open
 *
 * Occasionally, the call to create a Confident CAPTCHA will fail, due to
 * upstream issues (failed API credentials, maintenance downtime, etc.).
 * For a page like a contact form, it is better that some automated spam gets
 * through instead of blocking all legimate users.
 *
 * When there is an upstream issue, this policy will hide the CAPTCHA, and
 * CAPTCHA confirmation will succeed.  It requires that the server stores
 * the CAPTCHA state in a session variable or some other persistance scheme.
