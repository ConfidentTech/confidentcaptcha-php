 * For a page like a contact form, it is better that some automated spam gets
 * through instead of blocking all legimate users.
 *
 * When there is an upstream issue, this policy will hide the CAPTCHA, and
 * CAPTCHA confirmation will succeed.  It requires that the server stores
 * the CAPTCHA state in a session variable or some other persistance scheme.
